## Game Design Notes

### Difficulty Distribution:
- **Easy (4 questions):** Common astronomical knowledge
- **Medium (12 questions):** Reasonable estimates for educated players
- **Hard (7 questions):** Specialized knowledge
- **Very Hard (2 questions):** Expert-level astronomy

### Question Categories:
- **Distances:** 7 questions (Moon, Mars, Proxima, Andromeda, etc.)
- **Sizes/Diameters:** 5 questions (Sun, Earth, Jupiter, etc.)
- **Temperatures:** 3 questions (Sun, Space, Venus)
- **Speeds:** 3 questions (Light, Earth orbit, Escape velocity)
- **Quantities:** 4 questions (Stars, Moons, Galaxies, Satellites)
